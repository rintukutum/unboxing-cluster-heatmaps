Survey Figures
==============

This directory contains all of the static images used in the surveys. The images following the naming convention `[technique]-[type]-[info].png`, where `[technique]` is the visualization technique used, `[type]` is either `train` if the question was a training question and untimed and `main` if the question was timed, and `[info]` describes what is depicted in the image. For example, [`packing-training-siblings.png`](packing-training-siblings.png) uses circle packing, is a training question, and highlights siblings.
